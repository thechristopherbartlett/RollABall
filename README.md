  These three files allow for different controls of the ball character in the game. The other features inside of the game were made using the Unity Engine. 
The ball character, terrain, and camera view were made using non-code buttons within the engine. The file CameraController.cs allows for the camera to follow
behind the ball in a third person view. The file PlayerController.cs has a few functions. The function Start will display "Start" on the screen at the launch
of the game. The function SetCountText displays a counter that will go up when a "coin" is collected and OnTriggerEnter will increase the counter when a
"coin" is collected. The function OnMove gives values to the players inputs on the arrow keys to allow for the ball to move and FixedUpdate gives a 
multiplying speed to the ball.
